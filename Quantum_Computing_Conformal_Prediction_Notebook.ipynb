        "\n",
        "In modern quantum computing research, the ability to create synthetic datasets that mimic the behavior of quantum circuits is essential for both theoretical investigations and software-based experiments. This is particularly important when investigating *conformal prediction* methods as applied to *quantum-generated data*. Conformal prediction (in a classical or quantum sense) aims to produce *set predictions* with guaranteed coverage probabilities—an approach that can be invaluable in uncertain or noisy quantum environments.\n",
        "\n",
        "Below, we present **a highly detailed, explanation** of the data generation process, focusing on the creation of synthetic examples from **2-qubit quantum circuits**. We proceed with methodical care to ensure that researchers (both quantum experts and novices) can replicate or adapt these methods.\n",

        "## **1.2 Background: Quantum Circuits & Why 2 Qubits?**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Qubits**:  \n",
        "   A qubit is the fundamental unit of quantum information, analogous to a classical bit yet capable of existing in superpositions of \\(|0\\rangle\\) and \\(|1\\rangle\\). Two qubits combined together form a 4-dimensional Hilbert space, spanned by \\(\\{|00\\rangle, |01\\rangle, |10\\rangle, |11\\rangle\\}\\).  \n",
        "\n",
        "2. **QuantumCircuit in Qiskit**:  \n",
        "   - [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/) is an open-source quantum computing framework provided by IBM. It allows researchers to construct quantum circuits, apply gates, and simulate or run them on real quantum hardware.  \n",
        "   - The `QuantumCircuit` class is the core data structure for representing a quantum computation. It tracks the number of qubits, the quantum gates applied, the measurement operations, and so on.  \n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Why 2-Qubit Circuits?**  \n",
        "   - **Complex Enough but Manageable**: 2-qubit circuits allow for entanglement while remaining relatively simple to simulate or interpret.  \n",
        "   - **Data Dimensionality**: When measuring two qubits in the computational basis, we obtain a probability distribution over 4 possible outcomes: \\(\\{00, 01, 10, 11\\}\\). Each generated example is thus a 4D probability vector \\((p_{00}, p_{01}, p_{10}, p_{11})\\).  \n",
        "   - **Extensibility**: This approach can easily scale to 3, 4, or more qubits, but the complexity of enumerating or simulating grows exponentially.\n",

        "  1. `depth`: The integer specifying circuit depth (e.g., from 1 to 8).  \n",
        "  2. `total_ops`: The total number of gates used.  \n",
        "  3. `count_X, count_H, \\ldots`: The count of each gate type used.  \n",
        "- **Labels**:  \n",
        "  1. \\((p_{00}, p_{01}, p_{10}, p_{11})\\): The empirical probability distribution measured from the circuit after running a certain number of shots.\n",

        "### **1.3.1 Step 1: Random Depth and Gate Selection**\n",
        "\n",
        "- We fix a range \\(\\text{[min\\_depth, max\\_depth]}\\), e.g., \\([1,8]\\). For each sample, we choose a random depth in this interval.  \n",
        "- We create a 2-qubit random circuit via Qiskit’s `random_circuit(...)` function, specifying the chosen depth and a random seed. The random circuit is built by randomly selecting from gates (e.g., `X, H, Z, CX`, etc.).  \n",
        "\n",
        "### **1.3.2 Step 2: Measuring the Circuit**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Measurement Shots**: We specify a number of shots, say 1024, which is how many times we run (simulate) the circuit. On each run, the circuit collapses into one of the basis states \\(\\{|00\\rangle, |01\\rangle, |10\\rangle, |11\\rangle\\}\\).  \n",
        "- **Resulting Probability Distribution**: By counting how many times each outcome string (00, 01, 10, 11) occurs, we can form the empirical distribution\n",
        "  \\[\n",
        "    p_{00} = \\frac{n_{00}}{n_{tot}}, \\quad p_{01} = \\frac{n_{01}}{n_{tot}}, \\quad p_{10} = \\frac{n_{10}}{n_{tot}}, \\quad p_{11} = \\frac{n_{11}}{n_{tot}}\n",

        "- Single-qubit gates: `H, X, Y, Z, RX, RY, RZ, T, S, SX`  \n",
        "- Two-qubit gates: `CX, CCX, RXX, RYY, RZZ`  \n",
        "By counting each type, we build a feature vector of length 17 (plus `depth` and `total_ops` included).  \n",
        "\n",
        "### **1.3.4 Step 4: Collecting and Saving**\n",
        "\n",
        "We store each sample in arrays:\n",
        "- **`X_data`**: A 2D array of shape `(N_SAMPLES, 17)` containing the features.  \n",
        "- **`Y_data`**: A 2D array of shape `(N_SAMPLES, 4)` containing the measured probabilities.  \n",

        "\n",
        "In some cases, **duplicate feature rows** can arise: distinct random seeds might produce an identical gate composition. Or certain random circuits might converge to the same structure. This can lead to different measured distributions \\((p_{00},p_{01},p_{10},p_{11})\\) for the exact same feature vector.  \n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Data Loading**:\n",
        "   - We specify a `.npz` file, e.g., `\"quantum_data_no_duplicates.npz\"`, which contains `X_data` (feature matrix) and `Y_data` (4D probability vectors).  \n",
        "   - After loading, we do a train/test split so that we have a held-out set for either calibration or final test coverage measurements.  \n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Fitting a Random Forest**:\n",
        "   - We train on `(X_train, Y_train)`, i.e. feature gate counts vs. the 4D distribution.  \n",
        "   - We measure MSE to see how well the regressor does overall.  \n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Compute Residuals**:\n",
        "   - We infer predictions \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) on the calibration (or test) portion.  \n",
        "   - We define residual `residual_i = L∞(Y_i - Yhat_i)`.  \n",
        "   - We sort the residuals from lowest to highest.  \n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Identify the \\(\\tau\\) for each \\(\\alpha\\)**:\n",
        "   - The typical formula is \\(\\tau_{\\alpha} = \\text{the }(1-\\alpha)\\times(N+1)\\text{-th quantile}\\).  \n",
        "   - This ensures that \\(\\approx (1-\\alpha)\\) fraction of calibration points have residual \\(\\le \\tau\\).  \n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Coverage & Sizes**:\n",
        "   - For each \\(\\alpha\\), we compute coverage = fraction of points whose residual \\(\\le \\tau_{\\alpha}\\).  \n",
        "   - We also compute “sum-size” = \\(4 \\times 2\\tau_{\\alpha}\\) or “volume” = \\((2\\tau_{\\alpha})^4\\).  \n",
        "\n",
        "By examining these values, we can choose \\(\\alpha\\) that best meets our coverage vs. set-size needs.\n",

        "## **2.4 Points of Caution**\n",
        "\n",
        "- If your training set is small, or your features do not strongly correlate with the outputs, coverage might be forced large, leading to massive hypercubes in 4D space.  \n",
        "- For bigger data, coverage can be maintained with smaller \\(\\tau\\).  \n",
        "- Real quantum hardware noise can produce large variance in \\((p_{00},p_{01},p_{10},p_{11})\\). If your model can’t capture that variance, the conformal sets might blow up.  \n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## **2.5 Example Code & Outputs**\n",
        "\n",
        "Below, we present the final code cell that:  \n",
        "1. Loads the data file (the duplicates-free `.npz`).  \n",
        "2. Splits into train/test.  \n",
        "3. Trains the random forest.  \n",
        "4. Computes distributional conformal residuals.  \n",
        "5. Prints coverage and set size for multiple \\(\\alpha\\) values.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the sample output, you might see coverage near or above the desired levels. Meanwhile, the volume can vary drastically between e.g. \\(\\alpha=0.05\\) (leading to big \\(\\tau\\)) and \\(\\alpha=0.3\\) or \\(\\alpha=0.5\\).\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach overcame the dimension-wise problem, which gave zero coverage in some prior experiments (the predicted intervals basically collapsed). By using a single scalar measure of the 4D error, we harness the synergy across the correlated probabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, do note that advanced conformal methods exist—like *adaptive weighting* or *quantile regression*—which might further refine the 4D shapes, but this basic L∞ approach already suffices to demonstrate valid coverage in a quantum scenario.\n",

        "  - The actual measured distribution from the circuit was heavily concentrated in the second bitstring \\((p_{01}=0.7305)\\) with a remainder in \\((p_{11}=0.2695)\\). The model predicted, however, that there would be a moderate spread across multiple outcomes, such as \\((p_{00}=0.3058, p_{01}=0.2101, ...)\\). This suggests a mismatch, especially for dimension `p_{01}`—the model underestimates it.  \n",
        "\n",
        "  Observing the other examples, we see a variety of ground truths: some are very close to \\((1.0, 0, 0, 0)\\) or \\((0, 0.5332, 0, 0.4589)\\). The predicted distributions do sometimes approximate them but exhibit shortfalls (e.g., the second example is predicted with a more “smeared” distribution than the real strong peaks in the ground truth).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why it matters**: Inspecting a handful of data points at the raw input-output level helps us confirm that the regressor is capturing the broad shape but missing important spikiness. This mismatch is exactly why conformal sets might need to be sizable to guarantee coverage.\n",

        "   - **\\(\\alpha=0.05\\)** means we desire 95% coverage.  \n",
        "   - The measured coverage on the test set is about 96.3%, which meets (and slightly exceeds) the target.  \n",
        "   - **`radius=0.7729`**: This is our L∞ threshold \\(\\tau\\). In each dimension, the conformal set extends \\(\\pm 0.7729\\) around the model’s point prediction \\(\\hat{y}\\).  \n",
        "   - **`sum-size=6.184`** is 8× the radius if we have 4 dimensions (strictly it’s 4×(2×\\(\\tau\\)) = 8\\(\\tau\\)). So 8 × 0.7729 = 6.18 (approx).  \n",
        "   - **`volume=5.71086`** is \\((2 \\times 0.7729)^4\\). This is the 4D hypercube volume, quite large for \\(\\alpha=0.05\\).\n",

        "3. **Progressively** at \\(\\alpha=0.20\\), \\(\\alpha=0.30\\), and \\(\\alpha=0.50\\), the coverage requirement is relaxed, leading to smaller radii \\(\\tau\\). In exchange, the fraction of test points that lie within the conformal set also decreases accordingly.  \n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Aim**: Our overarching goal was to produce well-calibrated intervals (or hypercubes) around the model’s predicted 4D distribution \\((\\hat{p}_{00}, \\hat{p}_{01}, \\hat{p}_{10}, \\hat{p}_{11})\\). The results confirm that for each chosen \\(\\alpha\\), the coverage approximates or surpasses \\(1-\\alpha\\), signifying that our distributional conformal approach is working “as advertised.”  \n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Approach**: By employing an L∞ single-scalar residual approach, we overcame dimension-wise coverage collapse and achieved consistent coverage across the four correlated probabilities.  \n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Results**:  \n",
        "   - The random forest regressor does not predict extremely peaky distributions with perfect accuracy, resulting in a moderate MSE (0.0732). Consequently, the conformal intervals can be fairly large, particularly for stricter coverage levels (\\(\\alpha=0.05\\)).  \n",
        "   - Observing coverage close to the nominal \\(1-\\alpha\\) validates the correctness of the method: Qiskit-based quantum data plus a classical multi-output regressor plus distributional conformal yields robust error bars.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Possible Future Directions**:  \n",
        "   - **Enhanced Models**: Using more specialized regressors (e.g., neural networks, gradient boosting) or quantum-aware architectures might reduce the baseline MSE and hence produce narrower conformal sets.  \n",
        "   - **Refined Scoring**: Instead of a straightforward L∞ metric, we could adopt L1, L2, or even custom scoring that accounts for the sum-to-one constraint.  \n",
        "   - **Hardware Implementation**: Real NISQ quantum devices can introduce noise and gate errors, so testing the pipeline on hardware-based data would clarify how robust distributional conformal sets remain under real quantum conditions.  \n",
        "   - **High-Qubit / High-Depth**: For 3 or more qubits, the label dimension grows (8, 16, ...). Investigating conformal coverage in those higher-dimensional spaces could reveal new patterns in coverage-size trade-offs.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Impacts**:  \n",
        "   - **Reliability**: Our pipeline ensures that when we claim “the circuit distribution is likely in a certain region,” we have a statistically grounded guarantee. This fosters trust in quantum machine learning outputs.  \n",
        "   - **Applications**: Such coverage analysis could be integrated into quantum algorithm design, quantum error mitigation, or any scenario where robust probability estimates are vital.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the results confirm that **our distributional conformal approach** can effectively produce reliable coverage intervals (or hypercubes) for quantum-generated distributions. The coverage vs. interval-size trade-off is evident, pointing to the standard interplay between “confidence” and “precision.” While the MSE indicates the model’s limitations in capturing the occasional spiky distributions, the conformal sets expand as needed to maintain guaranteed coverage. This synergy—classical regressors plus quantum data plus conformal intervals—opens up numerous pathways for future quantum machine learning methodologies.\n"
