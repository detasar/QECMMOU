        "1. Create a random 2-qubit quantum circuit:\n",
        "   - A parameterizable circuit with random operations or a user-chosen design.\n",
        "   - Possibly use Qiskit's `random_circuit` or custom gates to produce different states.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. For each circuit instance (with random seeds or random parameters):\n",
        "   - Simulate (or run on hardware) in the Z-basis.\n",
        "   - Then apply transforms or re-initialize and measure in X-basis.\n",
        "   - Then measure in Y-basis.\n",
        "   - This yields three arrays of measurement outcomes: Mz, Mx, My.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Convert measurement bitstrings from each basis into integer or categorical features.\n",
        "   - For 2 qubits, in the Z basis, \"00\", \"01\", \"10\", \"11\" are typical.\n",
        "   - In the X basis, \"++\", \"+-\", \"-+\", \"--\" or something akin.\n",
        "   - Or we can store the raw bitstrings as features, or we can store their counts.\n",
        "   - We can also store the empirical distribution across these bitstrings.\n",
        "     E.g., (p00, p01, p10, p11) for each basis.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Summarize these distribution vectors as the \"label\" or as \"feature\" depending on the user design.\n",
        "   For multi-head conformal \"toy\" demonstration, let's store them as \"heads.\"\n",
        "   We can treat them as if they are separate \"predictions\" from each basis, or separate random samples.\n",
        "   Then we might define a final label or final target.\n",
        "   There's some design space here:\n",
        "   - The dataset might store (X_features, [Mz, Mx, My]) as \"heads,\"\n",
        "     and the final \"true label\" might be some function of the circuit parameters\n",
        "     or we may create an artificially assigned \"y\" for classification or regression.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Save or return the resulting dataset as a structure with shape:\n",
        "   - X_data shape: (#samples, #features). Possibly we store circuit depth,\n",
        "     random seeds, gate counts, etc., or any classical features we like.\n",
        "   - Y_data shape: (#samples, #heads) if we want each basis to be one dimension of the output.\n",
        "     Alternatively, store them as bigger arrays.\n",

        "We have produced data where:\n",
        " - X_data: shape (#samples, 2) => [depth, total_ops] or something similar\n",
        " - Y_data: shape (#samples, 12) => concatenation of [Zvec(4), Xvec(4), Yvec(4)]\n",
        "\n",
        "So each sample i has Y[i] = [Z00, Z01, Z10, Z11, X00, X01, X10, X11, Y00, Y01, Y10, Y11].\n",
        "Hence, we effectively have \"3 heads,\" each of dimension 4.\n",
        "We want a multi-head conformal approach that yields a set predictor in R^{12}.\n",
        "But that might be too big. Typically, conformal intervals are done in R^1 or small dimension.\n",
        "In the distributional approach, we can define a single scalar residual that merges these 12 outputs\n",
        "(for instance, we do some distance measure with a trained regression model).\n",
        "Alternatively, we can do “multi-dimensional conformal,” but it’s more advanced.\n",
        "As a simpler approach, we do the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Approach**:\n",
        "1. Train a multi-output regressor f(x) -> R^{12}. We'll do something trivial (like a RandomForestRegressor with 12 outputs).\n",
        "2. For each data point i in the calibration set, define a \"residual\" or \"score\" as the L1 or L2 distance between predicted Y[i]_pred and actual Y[i].\n",
        "3. Then standard “Distributional Conformal” in single-scalar sense:\n",
        "   - Sort these residuals,\n",
        "   - pick the (1-alpha) quantile as 'radius' => tau,\n",
        "   - For a new test point x*, we produce the predicted center y* = f(x*).\n",
        "   - Then the conformal set is all points z in R^{12} s.t. dist(z, y*) <= tau.\n",
        "   That is, a 12-dimensional ball of radius tau.\n",
        "   This is a naive multi-dim approach, but it's a single radius approach (the “minmax” approach might define hyper-rectangles, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Implementation**:\n",
        "- We'll do a train/test split: use ~80% for training, 20% for \"calibration\" or \"test\"? Actually, we typically do 3 sets: train, calibration, test.\n",
        "  But let's do the simpler approach:\n",
        "   - we do a partial: 70% train, 15% calibration, 15% final test.\n",
        "   - Then define a distributional conformal approach with the calibration portion.\n",
        "   - Evaluate coverage on the final test portion.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Coverage Metric**:\n",
        "- For each test point, we see if the L2 distance between the predicted center f(x*) and the true label y* is <= tau.\n",
        "- We'll measure the fraction that is inside the ball => coverage.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Caveat**:\n",
        "This is a \"toy\" code. We are ignoring advanced correlation structure, advanced drift, etc.\n",
        "But it demonstrates the idea.\n",
        "We call it \"multi-head\" because each data sample is effectively a concatenation of multiple measurement heads.\n",
        "Hence we do 1 unified conformal set in R^{12}.\n",
        "One might create separate sets for each basis or do more sophisticated integration.\n",
        "But let's do the single-ball approach to keep it minimal in code.\n",
